Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels 

Every day for 25 days this month you have small programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree". Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills.
